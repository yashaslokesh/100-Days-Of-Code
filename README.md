### This is my #100DaysOfCode Repository

I found out about this challenge while listening to [episode #140 of the Talk Python to Me podcast. ](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/140/level-up-your-python-with-100daysofcode-challenge "Talk Python to Me podcast: ") I thought this challenge would be a good practice for me to get better at the programming languages that I want to learn, and I started with Python.
